      <h2>In extreme times, the material cultures we cultivate and the lore woven through our generation to the next may form bridges toward livable futures. 
          California, where we are from, is a region of extremes. Years of drought are followed by storms that sweep the cliffside highway into the sea. 
          Fires rage through untended mountain kindling. Trailhead signs warn of poison snakes and walkers listen for the rattle. 
          Joan Didion once wrote that it is the law of the west to kill a snake once you have seen it, that it is your duty to follow it into the brush if you must, to protect those who might come after you.</h2>
